# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Optimized-Routing-Protocols-for-High-Performance-Mobile-Ad-Hoc-Networks
In this research paper, we have implemented the Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and Genetic algorithms in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANET) using NS2 and NetworkX in Python. We optimized these algorithms based on six criteria—bandwidth, mobility, transmission power, battery capacity, packet loss, and health—achieving a 90% increase in transmission health.
